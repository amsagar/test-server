-- Response styles are now owned by exactly one assistant. Previously they were global presets seeded
-- once. Migrate idempotently without dollar-quoted blocks (Spring's script runner splits on ';' and
-- can't parse PL/pgSQL DO blocks): add the owner column NULLABLE, drop any owner-less rows (only
-- legacy global rows ever have NULL; a session's style_id FK is ON DELETE SET NULL, so pinned
-- sessions stay usable), then enforce NOT NULL. No-op once migrated, so schema init (mode: always)
-- does NOT wipe styles on restart. On a fresh DB the column already exists NOT NULL from CREATE above.
